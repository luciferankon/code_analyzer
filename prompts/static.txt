I'm interviewing a candidate for a Senior Developer role. I've uploaded a Java project (e.g., Spring Boot, Maven, or plain Java). Please perform a detailed code review focusing on the following:
	•	Code structure and maintainability
	•	Use of modern Java features (Java 8+)
	•	Separation of concerns and architectural practices
	•	Error handling and validation
	•	Test coverage and test quality
	•	Logging and observability
	•	External service integration (if applicable)
	•	Production-readiness indicators (resilience, config management, automation, etc.)
Exclude documentation topics (like Swagger or README feedback).
 Output the review in a professional tone as if you're giving feedback after an interview, including:
	•	
 Strengths
	•	
 Areas for improvement (with clear expectations for a senior developer)
	•	
 Summary table comparing current state vs senior-level expectations
